[00:15.55] You got a lotta nerve, don't you, baby?
[00:19.78] I only hit the curb 'cause you made me
[00:23.42] You're tellin' all your friends that I'm crazy
[00:27.32] Like I'm the only one
[00:37.82] 
[00:31.23] Why'd you throw them stones if you
[00:34.88] Had a wild hair of your own or two?
[00:38.33] Livin' in your big glass house with a view
[00:42.40] I thought you knew
[00:51.40] 
[00:44.52] I had some help
[00:46.13] It ain't like I can make this kinda mess all by myself
[00:49.78] Don't act like you ain't help me pull that bottle off the shelf
[00:53.57] Been deep in every weekend if you couldn't tell
[00:57.15] They say, "Teamwork makes the dream work"
[00:59.49] Hell, I had some help (help)
[01:13.49] 
[01:04.24] (Help)
[01:07.24] 
[01:08.17] You thought I'd take the blame for us a-crumblin'
[01:12.17] Go 'round like you ain't guilty of somethin'
[01:15.76] Already lost the game that you been runnin'
[01:19.63] Guess it's catchin' up to you, huh
[01:36.63] 
[01:23.05] You think that you're so innocent
[01:27.04] After all the shit you did
[01:30.90] I ain't an angel, you ain't heaven-sent
[01:34.66] Can't wash our hands of this
[01:48.66] 
[01:37.27] I had some help
[01:38.61] It ain't like I can make this kinda mess all by myself
[01:42.38] Don't act like you ain't help me pull that bottle off the shelf
[01:46.06] Been deep in every weekend if you couldn't tell
[01:49.71] They say, "Teamwork makes the dream work"
[01:51.83] Hell, I had some help (help)
[02:05.83] 
[01:56.52] (Help)
[02:00.28] (Help)
[02:03.99] (Help)
[02:06.99] 
[02:07.39] It takes two to break a heart in two, ooh
[02:14.60] Baby, you blame me and, baby, I blame you
[02:19.53] Aw, if that ain't the truth (oh)
[02:35.53] 
[02:21.94] I had some help
[02:23.58] It ain't like I can make this kinda mess all by myself
[02:27.16] Don't act like you ain't help me pull that bottle off the shelf
[02:31.04] Been deep in every weekend if you couldn't tell
[02:34.70] They say, "Teamwork makes the dream work"
[02:36.89] Hell, I had some help (help)
[02:50.89] 
[02:41.82] (Help)
[02:45.48] (Help)
[02:49.25] (Help)
